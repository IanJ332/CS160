        <h1>Project 1: Local Jira</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            During <strong>CS151 (Object-Oriented Design)</strong>, I developed a software similar to Jira. The primary purpose of this project was to enable 
            individuals to track their projects more efficiently by synchronizing previous unfinished code. We implemented various tags such as 
            <strong>development, fixes, and updates</strong> to streamline the workflow.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, we designed an interface that integrates with <strong>Eclipse</strong>. This interface allows users to:
            <ul>
                <li>Select a piece of code.</li>
                <li>Create a ticket for it directly from the interface.</li>
                <li>Reopen the software later, click on the ticket, and jump to the specific code section needing modification.</li>
                <li>Automatically launch Eclipse software for code editing.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quick Ticket Creation:</strong> Create tickets that link to specific code sections, enabling quick access and modification.</li>
            <li><strong>To-Do List:</strong> Add new to-do items, create notes within the list, and keep track of tasks effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Time Tracking:</strong> Automatically display the user's current local time and track personal timelines for project progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Encrypted Database:</strong> Securely store and manage project information using database encryption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            This project was built using a combination of <strong>Java</strong> for the backend logic and <strong>database encryption techniques</strong> to safeguard 
            project data. The integration with Eclipse was achieved through plugin development, making it user-friendly for developers working in 
            that environment.
