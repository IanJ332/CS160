        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project was developed during <strong>CS157A (Database Management Systems)</strong>. The main objective was to create a ticketing 
            website that provides functionalities such as publishing events, deleting events, modifying event details, and adding information 
            like <strong>pictures, time, location</strong>. It also supports automatic redirection to Google Maps for event locations.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can make purchases, request refunds, bind payment information, rate events, and write reviews.</li>
            <li>Basic functionalities for event management include adding, editing, deleting, and viewing events.</li>
            <li>Google Maps integration for location-based navigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Performance Optimizations</h2>
        <p>
            Significant efforts were made to optimize the backend database for better performance under heavy workloads. 
            Advanced database concepts like <strong>optimistic locking</strong> and <strong>pessimistic locking</strong> were implemented to ensure data consistency and prevent logic errors in the system, even under high throughput.
